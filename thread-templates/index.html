She’d tried, of course, despite the niggling voice in the back of her mind telling her it wouldn’t do any good. She’d tried, for a handful of hours after Nealros had left, and that voice had been right. Somewhere around midnight, she guesses, is when she finally gives up.

    Over the Turns she’s grown used to the lack of light within the caverns of First Hold; especially this far into the bowels of the mountain, there’s very little that’s not cast in eerie darkness even with as many glows lit as they can manage. Being used to it doesn’t keep her skin from crawling when she’s feeling particularly vulnerable—and tonight is just…one of those nights.
    
    Ellariel’s first clue of her husband’s return is the fine hairs at the nape of her neck rising, an eerie kind of feeling that has her looking around the room for whatever could have caused a breeze in the dead air of the caverns. There aren’t many possibilities—and then Ellariel hears it. Her name, muddled, but not muddled enough that she doesn’t recognize the voice. A pit forms in the pit of her stomach because she recognizes that tone, even if she’d only heard the last echoes of it.
    
    The next time her name is heard, it’s much closer—and much louder. <i>Angry,</i> though she can’t think what she might have done to pull such a reaction out of her husband (it doesn’t have to be <i>because</i> of her for it to be directed <i>at</i> her, she reminds herself). It’s not as if she doesn’t know what Nealros does—she’s known for as long as she’s known <i>him,</i> even if she’d rather not think about it overmuch.
    
    Nealros’s stride is uneven enough as he nears the door that Ellariel guesses it was a bad night. Much as Rossk makes her uneasy at the best of times, she hopes the wher is alright—that he’s <i>alive,</i> at least. 
    
    Ellariel has enough time to open the door herself before Nealros reaches it, and at the sight of him—the blood, the bruises, the tattered condition of his clothes—she’s glad Rielsk is with the children tonight. 
    
    <q>Nealros,</q> she greets her husband, voice much quieter than his had been. Ellariel’s never been the outspoken type, but facing <i>this</i> only makes her voice smaller, less obtrusive in much the same way she wishes she could make the rest of her. Small enough to hide until she thinks it’s safe to venture out again, small enough to go unnoticed—but, no. She’s never been that lucky.
    
    Her gaze lingers warily on the chain in Nealros’s hand for just a moment before she steps back into their cave proper, fingers lingering on the edge of the door for as long as she can manage before finally relinquishing her grip on the wood.</div><div class="ellariel-tags">[user=342,9]Nealros[/user]</div></div></div>[/dohtml]
