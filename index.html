      <div class="valadrie-post">Everything starts to move so quickly after the second black hatches; Valadrie watches, barely daring to breathe at the almost comical standoff between him and his colorful bronze brother who looks like he's made of at least two different dragons until it's clear that they won't be at each other's throats quite yet. 

        The bronze makes a beeline for Tarvian, and Valadrie gives the other boy a small smile, as close to genuine excitement as he's going to get directed at anyone else, when it's clear the Impression has been made. He <i>is</i> happy for him, even if he's not all that interested in showing it.
        
        Before too long the event moves on regardless, revealing the somewhat disgruntled troubles of the little blue as he tried to free himself of the detritus of his egg. 
        
        Val almost misses it as the next egg cracks, his gaze drawn to it by the sound and movement from within. This one doesn't have any such issues with his shell or the fluids that stain the Sands from within, and he likewise wastes no time in making his way towards the Candidates.
        
        <ossideth>Valadrie,</ossideth> 
        
        He doesn't make the connection at first, going so far as to look around for the person who had spoken—but then it registered that the voice had been <i>inside his head.</i> 
        
        <ossideth>Come on. Don't make me walk all the way over there by myself.</ossideth> His voice is vaguely lilting, like a half-sung song that has Val moving across the Sands without fully processing the decision to do it. 
        
        <i>'I'm...sorry?'</i> There's a moment of awkwardness when they meet in the middle, Val realizing the way that Ossideth's insistent summons has made something of a spectacle of him--the only response to the mild irritation at that realization is a low, almost lyrical laugh in his head—before he manages to get them both turned in the right direction.
        
        He's been through this walk enough times in his head that the short trip to the feeding pavilion feels almost familiar, but this is an entirely new experience that, despite his family's affinity for dragonriding (he very pointedly doesn't think of Aubrean, who he'd glimpsed in the Stands despite doing his best to avoid looking), he hadn't been sure he'd ever experience.
        
        Not until it had happened, and Ossideth is suddenly <i>everywhere.</i> It's not a bad feeling, not even particularly overwhelming, but it's strange the way the dragon's name had just appeared in his mind without either of them having to say it. In terms of Impressing he hadn't had anything approaching the strength of <i>hopes,</i> but his upbringing being what it had been—it was always hard not to fall into the expectation of bronze, or even brown. A black wanting him had never quite registered as an option in his head.
        
        It's this thought that makes Ossideth snort audibly, and Valadrie eyes him as they finally enter the shade of the feeding pavilion. <ossideth>Maybe that's why I picked you,</ossideth> the dragon says, his voice now blatantly teasing—though it'd be clear enough even without the mental connection that he's entirely serious. Valadrie decides not to respond to that, taking advantage of the need for focusing on other things so he can chew on <i>that</i> comment for a while.
        
        After detouring for a bowl of meat and some oil, Valadrie has no choice but to follow as Ossideth picks out a spot for them to settle down for the rest of the Hatching. He's not as disappointed as he might have expected to find it only a small step sideways from the <i>center of attention—</i>and near enough to T'ian and his patchy little bronze that not at least exchanging <i>some</i> kind of conversation would be too standoffish even for Valadrie's prickly tendencies.
        
        <q>Congratulations,</q> he says as he sinks to the ground and offers the first of many moresels to Ossideth's hungry maw. Nodding in Quvameth's direction, he finds himself smiling again at the patchwork little bronze. <q>What's his name?</q>
